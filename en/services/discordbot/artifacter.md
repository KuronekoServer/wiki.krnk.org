## FAQ
> What is the number at the top of the image?

The number helps identify the time and internal ID when an image issue occurs. It contains no personally identifiable information.

> Why do images look similar to other bots?

The image generation code is published (https://github.com/FuroBath/ArtifacterImageGen) and multiple developers make bots based on it.

> `The application did not respond` or `Interaction failed` errors appear.

The bot or EnkaNetwork might be under maintenance. Check [Enka.Network Status](https://status.enka.network) and [KuronekoServer Status](https://status.krnk.org). If not listed, please notify #🚨お問い合わせ on our [support server](https://discord.krnk.org).
